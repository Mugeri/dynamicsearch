## Dynamic Search
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The goal is to search through an api for some data, the search parameters are then shown on the input field and the url parameters.
The data that fits the criteria of the parameters is displayed under the search field.
In this case, I have used mock api data found in the file `friends.js`.

To run it:
- `git clone` the project
- navigate to the project folder `cd dynamicsearch`
- run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- run `yarn start` to run the project.

The app will open on `localhost:3000` in your browser.
